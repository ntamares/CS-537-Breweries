Known issues</h1>

<p class="whs2">Internationalization issues: Potential problems 
 reading shapefiles on different locales</p>

<p>Very often, a shapefile's dBASE file will contain a specific language 
 id, other than the &quot;default&quot; language id. This will reflect 
 the system locale that the dBASE file was created on. MapObjects—Java 
 uses this id to properly encode string data from that dBASE file. Also, 
 shapefiles may have an associated .cpg file that contains the proper encoding 
 information for that shapefile. MapObjects—Java applications will read 
 the .cpg file for correct encoding and can also write this .cpg file during 
 a shapefile creation process to reflect the locale it was created on.</p>

<p>Problems with reading shapefiles in a MapObjects—Java application could 
 occur if the shapefile's language id is not set, which tells the system 
 to encode string data using the current system locale, and a .cpg file 
 is not present for that shapefile. Incorrect display of data and/or labels 
 may result from this condition, and it is possible that some shapefiles 
 may not be able to be opened at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Resources are not closed, resulting in &quot;Too 
 many open files&quot; error when running the Tutorial sample on Macintosh</p>

<p>The default number of file descriptors in Mac OS X is 256. Other UNIX 
 platforms may have the same problem if they have the same limit. A work-around 
 is to increase the limit by adding this command:</p>

<p>limit descriptors 1024</p>

<p>This should be done in the shell window immediately before entering 
 &quot;./StartTutorial&quot;. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Issue with ArcSDE 8.3 and Oracle servers</B></span> 
 </p>

<p>When reading BLOB fields larger than 60k from ArcSDE, an &quot;com.esri.sde.sdk.client.SeException: 
 NETWORK I/O OPERATION FAILED&quot; error might occur. This problem is 
 taken care of in Java SDK API for ArcGIS 9.0.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Using ArcSDE 8.3 and Informix connection 
 issue</p>

<p>Accessing a layer or a table when connected to an ArcSDE 8.3 and Informix 
 server may hang. This problem should be taken care of in Java SDK API 
 for ArcGIS 9.0.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Issue with null geometry layer in ArcSDE</p>

<p>Accessing a feature in an ArcSDE layer with null geometry throws NullPointerException. 
 This problem is fixed in Java SDK API for ArcGIS 9.0.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Duplicate JAR files in classpath may 
 cause problems</B></span> </p>

<p>Having duplicate JAR files in the classpath may cause exceptions to 
 occur. Be sure to only have a single copy of each necessary JAR file in 
 the classpath.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">QueryBuilder and Find results do not show 
 when changing the CoordinateSystem after the query has been made and the 
 dialog is still open</p>

<p>Resulting records of Find and QueryBuilder are not guaranteed if the 
 CoordinateSystem is changed <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>after</I></span> 
 the query has been made and the dialog is still showing. A good application-level 
 solution to this issue might be to clear the query results if CoordinateSystem 
 has been changed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">The Table of Contents &nbsp;in 
 the Programmer’s Reference on the Macintosh only allows one topic to be 
 opened at once</p>

<p>Only one same-level topic in the table of contents of the Programmer’s 
 Reference may be open at once. For example, there are four main topic 
 books when you open the Programmer’s Reference. If you open one and then 
 open another, the first topic book will automatically close. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Layout View issues</p>

<p>The up/down arrows on the layout element frame properties (Border, Background, 
 Drop Shadow) may not work with single clicks. This can be resolved by 
 holding down on the arrow for a short period of time or by manually typing 
 in a value. This issue can also likely be resolved by using a JDK of 1.4.1 
 or higher.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Macintosh issues</p>

<p>During internal testing of JoViewPlus on the Macintosh (OS X with Java 
 1.4.1), there have been occasional crashes and segmentation faults. This 
 has been reported and is currently in Apple's bug queue.</p>

<p>Rendering of symbols. Occasionally, when using a triangle/square/star 
 symbol to represent point data, the symbols are not rendered on the map 
 or the toc.</p>

<p>Direct printing of the layout is not supported. The Image Export UI 
 dialog must be used to print the layout from a saved image. The printing 
 capability is dependent on a version of Java that supports javax.print.*, 
 and this is currently not in Apple's Java VM. The printing functionality 
 should work as soon as Apple releases a new version of Java that supports 
 javax.print.*.</p>
