This project will show a map of San Diego with several different craft beer breweries as the points of interest. 
Upon clicking on one of the breweries,  a window will pop up containing information about that certain breweries 
such as location, types of beer that they carry, and the company motto/logo.

Additional Notes:  
  - If you wish to download my files and run through Windows command line, you need to edit the moj_compile.bat  
    and moj_run.bat files. In moj_compile, you need to change lines 13 and 14 to where your JDK home and MOJO home  
	directories are, respectively. For moj_run, you need to change lines 13 and 19. In line 13, set your MOJO home  
	directory. In line 19, set the directory where your JRE is to run Java files.
